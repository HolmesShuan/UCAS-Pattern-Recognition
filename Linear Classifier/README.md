## Exercise
1. Write a program to implement the "batch perception" algorithm.    
(1) Starting with a = 0, apply your program to the training data from w_1 and w_2. 
Note that the number of iterations required for convergence.    
(2) Apply your program to the training data from w_3 and w_4. 
Note that the number of iterations required for convergence.  
2. Implement the Ho-Kashyap algorithm and apply it to the training data from w_1 and w_3.
Repeat to apply it to the training data from w_2 and w_4. Point out the training errors, and give some analyses.    
3. By using MSE multi-class extension to construct a classifier, learn from samples [0:8] to test samples[9:10].
